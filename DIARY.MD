## PROGRAMME PAGE

### Content Updates
- [x] Delete: Jean-Pierre Bekolo. Add Vincent Meessen. If you like: add Susanna Tomassini

### Text Formatting
- [x] Programme EN/NL: Erik will suggest a slightly adjusted text for the 3rd paragraph with an extra line in between as it looks long now for a mobile version. I will do that a.s.a.p.
- [ ] Programme EN/NL: The dates could be highlighted, for instance by underlining them or make them bold (and perhaps the times too)?
- [x] Programme EN/NL: the font of this text can be smaller, we prefer the font size of the 'about' section

---

## SCHEDULE PAGE

- [x] Schedule EN/NL: also here we think the font can be smaller, and the same size as the font of the 'about' section

---

## ABOUT PAGE

### Text Formatting
- [x] 2nd paragraph, please some font size as the third and fourth paragraph
- [x] Last paragraph: could this be two paragraphs by using a hard return before 'Deze editie van leff ontsluit …'
- [x] Last paragraph: could this be two paragraphs by using an extra hard return before 'This first edition of leff presents …' So add an extra line
- [x] About - festival EN/NL: I will suggest an extra line for the 3rd and 4th paragraph, to make shorter paragraphs, which makes the texts look more accessible
