                            <p>Bertrand Bonello (b. 1968, Nice) is a French filmmaker, composer, screenwriter and occasional actor. Trained as a musician, he brings a formal precision and density to films such as The Pornographer, House of Tolerance, Nocturama and Coma. Often blurring fiction with archival and essayistic modes, Bonello explores themes of desire, power, youth and the spectral traces of history. *Coma* (2022) is a hybrid essay film that fuses dream states, online media and philosophical voiceover into a reflection on confinement and the erosion of reality. His films have screened at Cannes, Venice and Locarno, and reflect a singular voice in contemporary European cinema.</p>

                            <p>Chantal Akerman (1950–2015, Brussels/Paris) was a Belgian filmmaker, installation artist and writer whose radical feminist and minimalist approach reshaped cinema. Her breakthrough Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) deconstructed domestic routine through extended takes and stillness, while films like News from Home, Je Tu Il Elle and D’Est deeply engaged themes of identity, exile, Jewish heritage and space. Over forty films and installations defined a legacy of formal rigor, emotional depth and feminist poetics.</p>

“We collect songs from older women with lyrics closely tied to their life stories. We volunteer with their needs. We learn to sing and play the instruments from local musicians. We experiment with when and how certain existences could be documented and shared with a wider public, understanding the importance of the specific contexts.”

Favouring a collaborative praxis and long-term research, their recent projects engage with past and present global mobilities. Their films manifest unheard voices, diasporic experiences and resistant subjectivities. They have created film programmes and exhibitions that revisit the historiography of moving image practices and ‘minor cinemas’. Their work has been presented in various exhibitions and film festivals, including Documenta 14, Courtisane, DOK Leipzig, Visions du Réel – where their film Chronicles of that time was awarded the Special Jury Award.</p>

Litvintseva (b. 1989, Murmansk; PhD Goldsmiths, senior lecturer at Queen Mary University) and Wagner (b. 1985, Berlin; Bard College, Jan van Eyck fellow) have co-created a trilogy of short films—A Demonstration (2020), Constant (2022) and My Want of You Partakes of Me (2023)—that trace the political histories of monsters, measurement standards and digestion. Their practice spans cinema, writing (as in All Thoughts Fly and Geological Filmmaking) and conceptual research.</p>

                            <p>Toyisha Tsunoda (b. 1964, Kanagawa, Japan) is a pioneering sound artist whose field recordings, acoustic collages and vibrational sculptures explore the phenomenology of perception and landscape. Trained originally in oil painting at Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, Tsunoda approaches field recording not as documentation but as subjective depiction—an immersive method of hearing place as alive, impermanent and in flux. Works such as Landscape and Voice and the Extract from Field Recording Archive series map vibrations and voice across spaces, drawing attention to the physical and poetic experience of listening.</p>

                            <p>Karin Nakajima, Sara Ouljour, and Veronica Munteau are filmmakers and students whose practices converge around the essay film as a space for reimagining politics, memory, and belonging. Nakajima approaches the form through its affinity with the unconventional, embracing strangeness as a way to probe how remembrance and identity take shape. Ouljour, based in Rotterdam and born in Morocco, turns to both film and writing to address questions of migration and anti-imperialism. Munteau, a Moldovan filmmaker and writer, moves fluidly between poetry, prose, and experimental cinema, her work unfolding through an intuitive process of noticing, questioning, and remembering. Together, their practices highlight the essay film’s potential as both a tool of inquiry and a mode of poetic and political expression.</p>

                            <p>Vincent Meessen (b. 1971, Baltimore, USA; lives in Brussels) is an artist, filmmaker, curator and researcher whose transdisciplinary practice reorients narration around colonial histories and multiple gazes. A founding member of collectives like Universal Embassy and Jubilee, he represented Belgium at the 56th Venice Biennale in 2015 with Personne et les autres. His work, including films such as Juste un mouvement, uses archival gestures, institutional critique and polyphonic strategies to destabilise fixed historiographies and foreground collective subjectivities.</p>
