                In film studies and festivals, a lot of attention has been paid in recent years to a special type of film: the essay film. It is the visual variant of the time-honoured written essay. With this, it has in common that it connects a personal quest with reflection and is practised both in art and science. At Leiden University, a team led by ACPA, the Academy of Creative and Performing Arts, is working on the first Dutch Essay Film Festival under the name LEFF. It will take place on 14 and 15 September at the Stadsgehoorzaal and the Kijkhuis in Leiden.<br>
                In this first edition of LEFF, many films will be screened, from the most current to classics. In the spirit of the essay, with lectures and discussions, LEFF also aims to be a place of reflection and dialogue. A broadly composed audience of film lovers, students, researchers and interested parties can get to know new film essays, filmmakers and theorists, and continue with them and each other the quests begun in the films.

            <h3>What is an essay film?</h3>
            <p>
                The essay film is a special film genre. It grew out of attempts by filmmakers, early in the history of the film medium, to deal with abstract subjects, and not only represent the world but also reflect on it. For a while, the genre was linked to documentary. Its namesake, Hans Richter, therefore saw it as a new form of documentary film in 1940. Since the mid-1950s, the essay film has experienced a steady rise. The first films had anthropological, historical and political subjects, but they were also, like all essay films, cross-disciplinary, hybrid, experimental and probing in nature. In the latter lies the core of the genre: they are films in which the maker seeks to better understand the world while searching, and also the own perspective under which the world is perceived.
