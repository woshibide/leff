- an interface is very much needed
- a better data structures are needed for text content
- it can be a json like nesting
    page {
        en {
            paragraph: blah blah blah
        }
        nl {
            paragraph: blah blah blah
        }
    }

    or

    page {
        paragraph {
            en {
                blah blah
            }
            nl {
                blah blah blah
            }
        }
    }

- in gui to have an option to show english/dutch version of the text (flip card?)
